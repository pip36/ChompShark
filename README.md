## Get Started

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed.
2. From a command line, run `npm install` in the root directory (same place this README.md file is).
3. Next run `npm run start:dev` to start an automatically updating instance.
4. Use the editor of your choice ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great choice) to start writing your game.
5. Run `npm run build` to populate the **public** directory with the final site contents.
6. Copy the contents of **public** to the site of your choice.
